TTmodeler
=========

TTmodeler integrates the model-based system and test design and creates a direct, automated connection to the powerful test development and execution environment TTworkbench. The UML Testing Profile (UTP) defines additional model elements for UML, which allow to define specifications of test objectives, test procedures and test valuations for systems and system components. UTP is a vital component for the alignment of system and test development methods. It contributes to the concept of model-centric systems design: System models and test models can be developed and aligned in all system development phases.
